CS111 Lab 1C README
===================
 - Works for simple cases
 - Too many race conditions to verify complex cases

Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Executes commands multiple times when case is complex

Approach
~~~~~~~~
We had a bool* array of finished processes to check if a process was finished.
When waitpid of a command tree is done, we execute all the commands dependent on that command tree.
Command graph implemented in way described in discussion.



CS111 Lab 1b README
===================

- Works for all devised test cases

- Contains changes to lab1a code for increased robustness



Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Multiple pipes in a command are not supported. This is alright since
TAs have stated that it will not tested for.

- Single quotes and double quotes are invalid tokens. See "Shell syntax
subset" section of the spec.

Approach
~~~~~~~~
One challenge was managing all the child processes so that
we don't create too many and we exit all of them.
We created a _nf function for execute_command and execute,
which stands for "no fork", which means it doesn't create a
child process.  Although there is duplicate code because of this,
it still works.
